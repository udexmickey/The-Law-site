                  <h4>SECURE Act: How It Will Affect You and the Beneficiaries of Your Retirement Accounts</h4>
                  <p><small>JULY 14, 2020 • BOYCE LAW FIRM, LLP</small></p>
                  <p>On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (SECURE Act). The SECURE Act became effective on January 1, 2020. The Act is the most impactful legislation affecting retirement accounts in decades. The SECURE Act has several positive changes: it increases the required beginning date (RBD) for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your individual retirement accounts from 70 ½ to 72 years of age, and it eliminates the age restriction for contributions to qualified retirement accounts.  However, perhaps the most significant change will affect the beneficiaries of your retirement accounts.  The SECURE Act requires most designated beneficiaries to withdraw the entire balance of an inherited retirement account within ten years of the account owner’s death.</p>
                  <p>The SECURE Act does, however, provide a few exceptions to this new mandatory ten-year withdrawal rule: spouses, beneficiaries who are not more than ten years younger than the account owner, the account owner’s children who have not reached the “age of majority,” disabled individuals, and chronically ill individuals.  However, proper analysis of your estate planning goals and planning for your intended beneficiaries’ circumstances are imperative to ensure your goals are accomplished and your beneficiaries are properly planned for.</p>
                  <p>Under the old law, beneficiaries of inherited retirement accounts could take distributions over their individual life expectancy. Under the SECURE Act, the shorter ten-year time frame for taking distributions will result in the acceleration of income tax due, possibly causing your beneficiaries to be bumped into a higher income tax bracket, thus receiving less of the funds contained in the retirement account than you may have originally anticipated.</p>

                  <h4>Review Intended Beneficiaries</h4>
                  <p>With the changes to the laws surrounding retirement accounts, now is a great time to review and confirm your retirement account information. Whichever estate planning strategy is appropriate for you, it is important that your beneficiary designation is filled out correctly, including naming contingent beneficiaries in case your primary beneficiary predeceases you.</p>
                  <p>If you have recently divorced or married, it is imperative that you revisit the beneficiary designations of your accounts!  In many cases, in many cases, the plan administrator of these accounts will distribute the account funds to the beneficiary listed, regardless of a divorce or remarriage, which may be inconsistent with your ultimate wishes.</p>
