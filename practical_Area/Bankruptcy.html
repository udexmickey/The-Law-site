                    <h2 id="bankruptcy">Bankruptcy Law</h2>
                  <p>Most people think of bankruptcy as a straightforward process that, unlike many court cases, doesn’t involve a dispute with someone else. You file paperwork and receive a discharge (the order that wipes out qualifying debt) without worrying that someone will object to your case.
                    For the vast majority of matters, that’s how it works. Although every creditor involved in bankruptcy could dispute the discharge, few do—primarily because they don’t often have grounds to make a challenge. But there are still opportunities for those involved (known as “interested parties,” such as the debtor, the creditors, and the trustee) to engage in full-blown litigation. In this article, you’ll learn how typical bankruptcy litigation occurs.

                  <h2 id="types">How the Bankruptcy Court Distinguishes Litigation Types</h2>
                  <dd> The bankruptcy rules distinguish between litigation matters based on their relationship to the bankruptcy itself. The distinction is important because it affects the jurisdiction and decision-making authority of the bankruptcy judge. </dd>
