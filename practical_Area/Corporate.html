                <p>Today, navigating the corporate compliance and legal landscape can be complicated. Although a degree of regulatory oversight has been rolled back in certain industries, businesses continue to face considerable compliance obligations. This is why business leaders must be proactive in adhering to rules and regulations, meeting their fiduciary obligations and establishing best practices.</p>

                  <p>we provide advice and guidance to private and public companies, nonprofit organizations, boards of directors, and senior management. Our corporate compliance and defense experience is invaluable in today’s complex business environment. We bring to bear significant trial and corporate experience to help our clients achieve successful outcomes.</p>                  
                  <p>Our compliance team has extensive experience with many of the laws affecting various industries and business today.  They include the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), among others.</p>
                  <p>We are also knowledgeable of rules and regulations promulgated by a number of federal and state agencies such as the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</a>, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">U.S. Department of Labor</a>, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>, the <a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/">Texas Commission on Environmental Quality</a>, the Texas Railroad Commission, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the Texas Workers’ Compensation Commission.</p>
                  <p>Our seasoned litigators have a proven track record of successfully representing both plaintiffs and defendants in state and federal courts and abroad. By understanding our clients’ objectives and their respective industries, we devise comprehensive corporate governance, compliance, and litigation strategies.</p>
                  <h4>Corporate Governance</h4>
                  <p>The corporate governance practice at Ajamie LLP is broad-based. We advise clients on matters such as oversight, risk management, and director and officer (D&O) indemnification. We also review and prepare corporate governance materials. In addition, we provide guidance on concerns such as best practices, fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest and liability, regulatory enforcement, public disclosures, succession planning, and transactional issues. Our attorneys work to identify and mitigate legal and regulatory issues that could place a company at risk.</p>
                  <h4>Director Liability</h4>
                  <p>Corporate directors can be held personally liable when a criminal proceeding or enforcement action causes significant financial losses or a decline in stock value. Additionally, directors, managers, and chief compliance officers may also be held liable for the unlawful actions of employees.</p>
                  <p>At Ajamie LLP, we evaluate existing governance structures, supervisory procedures, and training programs to identify areas of weakness. We design strategies to protect directors from liability and minimize the risk of an enforcement action. Our attorneys also represent directors and officers in civil litigation and administrative actions.</p>
                  <h4>Compliance Audits and Programs</h4>
                  <p>Violations of state and federal laws can lead to substantial penalties. However, it is possible to minimize this risk by implementing compliance policies and procedures. Our team conducts legal and compliance audits to discover and prevent violations. We also help design compliance programs that consider all relevant laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
                  <h4>Internal Investigations</h4>
                  <p>While conducting internal investigations can support a legal defense, the appearance of bias must be avoided. Our attorneys work as honest brokers in conducting internal investigations for public and private corporations, as well as non-profit organizations. We also vigorously defend our clients in government and regulatory investigations and civil enforcement actions when the need arises.</p>
