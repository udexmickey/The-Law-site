                  <h2>Definition of Constitutional Law</h2>
                  <p>Constitutional law refers to rights carved out in the federal and state constitutions. The majority of this body of law has developed from state and federal supreme court rulings, which interpret their respective constitutions and ensure that the laws passed by the legislature do not violate constitutional limits. </p>
                  <p>Most constitutional legal issues involve the Bill of Rights, which contains the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These amendments contain such rights as the freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to be free from certain types of discrimination.</p>
                  <p>States also have their own constitutions, which usually contain most, if not all, of the same rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. Many state constitutions also establish additional rights, but they may not take away any federal rights.</p>
                  <p>Constitutional law also involves the rights and powers of the branches of government. Both the federal and state constitutions outline three branches of government and give distinct powers and responsibilities to each one. Constitutional lawyers also help resolve disputes among the branches.</p>
                  <ul>

                  <h2>Other Considerations When Hiring a Constitutional Lawyer</h2>
                  <p>When people think of constitutional law, they naturally think of blockbuster cases like Brown v. Board of Education, which banned racial segregation in schools, or Roe v. Wade, which struck down state bans on some abortions. But many constitutional law cases are decided in lower state and federal courts, where everyday legal disputes can bring up constitutional issues. This is why many people consult constitutional law attorneys when facing any constitutional issue, no matter how big or small.</p>
